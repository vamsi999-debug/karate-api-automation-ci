# karate-api-automation-ci
Built a Karate DSL–based API automation framework to validate CRUD and negative scenarios against GoRest APIs. Identified and fixed shared payload mutation across scenarios by introducing reusable deep-cloning utilities. Integrated the framework with Jenkins (Docker) to run automated CI pipelines with JUnit and Karate HTML reports.
